Welcome to W.I.L.L.!
These directories contain the source code and files for W.I.L.L.
W.I.L.L. stands for Wireless Intelligent Linguistical Liveware and is a personal assistant,
created and maintained by Will Beddow.

GUI based plugin utility added! Tutorial video coming soon

Features on the way you can look forward to:
1. Improving intent parsing
2. Adding better html parsing for google search (see the open issue for more info)
3. Adding a slack plugin for automation
4. Finishing the spotify plugin
5. Slack backend channel support and multi device commuication capabilities

Adding features/plugins:
Anybody is welcome to add a plugin, it's in a farily self explanatory folder format with a plugin.json file that anybody who's worked with python, json, or programming before should be able to cleanly reverse engineer. I'm not planning to spend the time and write the documentation, but if somebody wants to I'd be happy to help and publish it. I'm also planning to eventually upload a plugin creation program.

Requesting a plugin be made:
I want W.I.L.L and it's community to grow and thrive, so if you want a feature or plugin added let me know and I'll see what I can do.
Steps:
1. Contact me at will@willbeddow.com with an idea. Note: I won't make anything illegal or that I consider immoral
2. I'll get to work. This is a side project that I do in my free time so it may take a few weeks
3. I'll include it in my personal alpha build for testing for up to a week.
4. Once all bugs are fixed it will be pushed to the plugins folder and available to all users.

Feel free to contact me for help, support, or ideas at will@willbeddow.com
